**The final product of my times table grid.**

I created this application by mapping N number of points around a circle of radius R, that N number of points is the modulo of the time tables.
I then use a for loop to draw a line from point i to point i * multiplier % modulo. 
the times tables are layed out in a grid that fits within a 1920x1080 screen.
